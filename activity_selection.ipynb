    "The Activity Selection algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to solve the problem of selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a set of activities, where each activity has a start and end time. The algorithm works by selecting the activity with the earliest end time, and then selecting the next activity that does not overlap with the previously selected activity, and so on, until no more activities can be selected."
