    "This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗) be the minimum amount of money required to purchase the first 𝑖 licenses, where the 𝑖-th license is bought in month 𝑗. We need to compute 𝐹(𝑛,𝑗) for all 𝑗 = 1,2,...,𝑛.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗), we have two options: either we buy the 𝑖-th license in month 𝑗, or we skip buying it in month 𝑗 and buy it in a later month. If we buy the 𝑖-th license in month 𝑗, then the total cost is 100𝑟𝑖𝑗 plus the cost of buying the first 𝑖−1 licenses in the previous 𝑗−1 months, which is 𝐹(𝑖−1,𝑗−1). If we skip buying the 𝑖-th license in month 𝑗, then the total cost is 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗−1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have the following recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝐹(𝑖,𝑗) = min{100𝑟𝑖𝑗 + 𝐹(𝑖−1,𝑗−1), 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗−1)}\n",
    "\n",
    "The base cases are 𝐹(0,𝑗) = 0 for all 𝑗, since we don't need to buy any licenses, and 𝐹(𝑖,0) = ∞ for all 𝑖 > 0, since we cannot buy any licenses in month 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal order to buy the licenses, we can keep track of the values of 𝑗 that minimize 𝐹(𝑛,𝑗) for each 𝑛. Starting from 𝑛 = 𝑛, we can backtrack through the optimal values of 𝑗 to obtain the optimal order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is 𝑂(𝑛^2), since we need to compute 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗) for all 𝑖 = 1,2,...,𝑛 and 𝑗 = 1,2,...,𝑛. However, we can optimize the algorithm by observing that 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗) depends only on 𝐹(𝑖−1,𝑗−1) and 𝐹(𝑖,𝑗−1), so we only need to keep track of two rows of the table at a time. This reduces the space complexity to 𝑂(𝑛)."
